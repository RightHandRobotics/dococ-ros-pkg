My IP address was 10.26.92.11, then 10.26.92.13

1) I got a BeagleBone Black, it came with a mini-USB cable
2) How I connected to it
    - Plugged the BBB into ethernet AND into Ubuntu via USB
    - Connect to the BBB using 'screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200' from Ubuntu (this opens a serial connection to the BBB)
    - Use 'ifconfig' over USB to get the eth0 IP address
    - Close 'screen' program, ssh into the BBB using 'ssh root@eth0IPAddress', where eth0IPAddress is the IP address found using 'ifconfig' over serial
3) Found the OS with 'lsb_release -a' (it was Debian Wheezy)
4) Try doing sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade. If you have massive problems with led_aging.sh like I did, follow the comment by Dirk Koopman: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/beagleboard/LPjCn4LEY2I
5) Started going through install instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Debian
    - pip install wasn't working for me, but these directions worked: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6012246/why-is-python-easy-install-not-working-on-my-mac
    - the 'pip install -U stuff' line was failing for me because of egg_info errors, the comment by zakx here fixed that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17688082/error-installing-with-pip/19410374#19410374
    - Note this note: "Note: Rosdep and apt-get may report that python-rosdep, python-catkin-pkg, python-rospkg, and python-rosdistro failed to install; however, you can ignore this error because they have already been installed with pip."
    - If you ever want to install new packages, follow the instructions at the bottom of the ROS Debian install tutorial
